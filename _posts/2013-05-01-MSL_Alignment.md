Accurate alignment of structure features on different PDMS layers before their permanent bonding is critical in determining the yield and quality of assembled multilayer microfluidic devices. Herein, we report a custom-built desktop aligner capable of both local and global alignments of PDMS layers covering a broad size range. Both local and global alignment accuracies of the desktop aligner were determined to be about 20 microns.

Design and build an alignment platform for MSL that allowed users to align two microfluidic layers quickly and with an accuracy of less than 20 microns. Went through a complete desing process from defining the problem and setting the user requirements to building and testing a prototype.
