Humans have amazing capabilites to jump of 3 story high and survive with no injuries. Legged robots are very far from realizing similar manuevers. We have designed a complete monoped to test our controller. Usually, transmission and motors are damaged due to the high impact forces. To mitigate this issue we propose a two-fold solution. 

1) Have a mechanical design that will aid the robot to passively survive the high imapct forces
2) Design a controller that will replicate human gaits used to manage high impact forces, such as knee flexion and rolling. 

I firmly believe this is the key for robots to emulate the proficiency of Parkour practitioners, and become part of the solution in areas such as the assistance in hazardous environments, search and rescue missions, and space exploration. 

We are no in process of purchaing and manufacturing all the required components to build it.

### ROLE:

Desing a human size monoped to withstand falls of at least 3m high
Designed robots electronics
Developed SimMechanics Model
Program novel controller that will decrease the impact force
Series elastic actuation
Motor selection
