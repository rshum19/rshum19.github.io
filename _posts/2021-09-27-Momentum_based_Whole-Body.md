In this paper, we present a planning and control framework for dynamic, whole-body motions for dynamically stable shape-accelerating mobile manipulators. TWe explore the use of centroidal dynamics and trajectory optimization to generate motion plans offline that are tracked online by cascading PD-PID controllers. We demonstrate that this framework is capable of generating dynamic motion plans and control inputs with examples on the CMU ballbot.
