FoamBot is a robot that assembles itself by combining modular robot components (CKBot modules) and casting foam that hardens to form the body. It consist of a main building robot that configures the CKBot modules into position and sprays the casting foam over it. When the foam cures the new robot will be able to move independently.

The advantage of this is that it is a multi-utility robot that is able to build itself to adapt to its environment. Today, robots are generally build towards a specific purpose and capable of overcoming known obstacles in their operating environment. With the FoamBot one can send a robot to someplace where the conditions are unknown and on the spot decided what is required and build it.

The casting foam is commercially available off-the-shelf. It is capable of expanding up to 30 times their initial size and is very strong. Therefore, the building robot can be significantly smaller than what it is building. Different density foams are commercially available to modify the strength and toughness. The foam will take a couple of hours to fully cure and be tack free.
