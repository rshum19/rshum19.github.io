Designed the hardware achitecture for a feasible orbital refueling station for deep space missions. Engineered fuel tanks, fuel tank hubs, docking, and refuelling system.

### PROJECT DESCRIPTION:

Reliable Refills is proposing a private mission named the Commercial Heavy-lift Orbital Refueling Depot (CHORD) to provide economically feasible orbital refueling for deep space missions. By decoupling cargo/propellant from the dry bus, CHORD will enable much higher mass payloads such as those necessary to complete manned missions to Mars or robotic landings on Titan. Additionally, refueling in orbit allows other missions to make use of more economic and frequent medium sized rocket launches as opposed to expensive and less reliable heavy-lift rockets.
