Crazyflie is a open source nano quadcopters. There were no ative Matlab(MEX) & Simulink clients to control the quadocpter. Commonly Matlab/Simulink is used to develop closed loop controllers. Thus, before this client it was required to communicate between different programming lannguages (python and matlab) introducing delay times. This project address this delays by creatinges a native matlab client. Deeveloped a cartesian space position tracking controller around it.
